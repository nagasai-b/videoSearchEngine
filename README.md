      This project is a part of our course named Database Management. 
      Here our website is powered by Django Framework. Features of this website include: 
           1) Algorithm finds the videos with matching tags and description with the given key word. 
           2) Search returns the top 5 results(if found) and will be displayed in a pannel.
           3) By selecting a video from the list of the videos from the given pannel it opens up the statistics of the selected video using data from MongoDb database.
           4) When a video is selected, in the side pannel videos related to selected video will be displayed from the relations to the current video in the neo4j database (Graph Database).
           5) Each individual has his own history of selected videos and recent queries. You can create a new account or login into an existing account or use the site as a random user.
           6) Each individual can clear their history and recents also.
           7) Feeling lucky option randomly selects a video from the database and displays it.
    
    I hope this gives an idea about this. Suggestions welcomed.
